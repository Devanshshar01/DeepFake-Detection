- GPU (GTX 1080): 3-6 hours (1,000 videos)
- GPU (RTX 3090): 1-2 hours (1,000 videos)

## How to Use Your Upgraded System

### Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset
```bash
# Create folder structure
mkdir -p data/train/real data/train/fake
mkdir -p data/val/real data/val/fake

# Add your videos:
# - Real videos → data/train/real/ and data/val/real/
# - Fake videos → data/train/fake/ and data/val/fake/
```

### Step 2: Start Training
```bash
python train_model.py
```

The model will:
- Display training configuration
- Show real-time progress with metrics
- Save best model automatically
- Track training history
- Apply early stopping when needed

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
Watch for:
- Training accuracy increasing over epochs
- Validation accuracy reaching 80-90%
- Loss decreasing steadily
- Best model saves

### Step 4: Launch the UI
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The UI now features:
- Professional design with gradient headers
- Video upload and analysis
- Detailed confidence visualizations
- Training metrics and history plots
- Model status and information

### Step 5: Test Videos
1. Upload a video through the UI
2. Get instant analysis with:
   - Fake/Real prediction
   - Confidence percentage
   - Probability breakdown
   - Visual charts
   - Detailed explanation

### Training Best Practices
✓ Start with default hyperparameters
✓ Monitor both training and validation accuracy
✓ Use GPU for faster training
✓ Let model train until early stopping
✓ Review training history plots

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- If overfitting: increase dropout, weight decay

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory
```yaml

batch_size: 2  # Reduce from 4
num_frames: 16  # Reduce from 20
```

### Low Accuracy (<75%)
1. Check dataset size (need 1,000+ videos)
2. Verify dataset balance (50/50 real/fake)
3. Ensure video quality
4. Train for more epochs

### Training Too Slow
1. Use GPU if available
2. Increase batch_size if memory allows
3. Increase num_workers for data loading
